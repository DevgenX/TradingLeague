# TradingLeague 


TradingLeague is a cryptocurrency trading game built on top of Binance data and Tradingview technical analysis charts. The application utilizes
React for frontend, NodeJS in the backend and MongoDB as the database. 

The application comes with 3 game modes. 

- Practice
- PvP
- Ranked Game 

Once you start the game, you will be paired with a random cryptocurrency token with its historical data in a random point of time. 

The goal is to make profits and win the game, either by getting higher profit vs your opponent for PvP. Or being able to secure profit after the alloted time.
